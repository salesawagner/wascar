So i call up google Sydney and the receptionist is trained to say oh no we don't handle anything like that sir and no we don't know of any numbers you can call so you can get it sorted out, there is only the online service that is all. So they come to our country want a presence, won't take responsibility for their works, want us to treat them fairly etc, off hand taking care of our businesses to some English as a second language speaking people, and thinks that will be enough. Quiet willing to take your money but give you nothing in return. and i only put a star in cause im forced to so i can post this complaint, You suck GOOGLE.",

There is no thought behind how the whole business review process works and the only answer you get from support staff is that they are only trained to direct people to the Google support page. Why do you need people at the end of a phone line to tell you that?\n\nAs it stands, there is nothing stopping me from standing in front of a store and giving a negative review to a business based on whether it was raining that day or not. There is no process here to verify if the claim of the user is right or not. I thought the whole process of reviews were meant to be a fair representation of the service the business provides. Where is the fairness here?\n\nGoogle encourages businesses to respond to people's reviews. Is Google responding to the reviews that are posted about their business? Why the double standards Google?",

Some how My business address was pinned in a different location to my REAL business address. They don't seem to understand that this would effect a working business and that your customers would be wandering around down the shopping stripe looking for you and then give up - Wow if this is the intelligence that is driving Google into the future I see a very short trip. All the reviews that I have read that are positive are about 90% regarding their wonderful work place - while mine stays empty because Google and its staff can't remove a Pin Marker.
